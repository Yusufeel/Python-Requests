As recently as May 31, 2023, the authoring organizations have observed an increase in cyber threat actors using new malware variants of Truebot (also known as Silence.Downloader). Truebot is a botnet that has been used by malicious cyber groups like CL0P Ransomware Gang to collect and exfiltrate information from its target victims. Previous Truebot malware variants were primarily delivered by cyber threat actors via malicious phishing email attachments; however, newer versions allow cyber threat actors to also gain initial access through exploiting CVE-2022-31199\u2014(a remote code execution vulnerability in the Netwrix Auditor application), enabling deployment of the malware at scale within the compromised environment. Based on confirmation from open-source reporting and analytical findings of Truebot variants, the authoring organizations assess cyber threat actors are leveraging both phishing campaigns with malicious redirect hyperlinks and CVE-2022-31199 to deliver new Truebot malware variants. The authoring organizations recommend hunting for the malicious activity using the guidance outlined in this CSA, as well as applying vendor patches to Netwrix Auditor (version 10.5\u2014see Mitigations section below).[1] Any organization identifying indicators of compromise (IOCs) within their environment should urgently apply the incident responses and mitigation measures detailed in this CSA and report the intrusion to CISA or the FBI.

                    "data": "Following the successful download of the malicous file, Truebot renames itself and then loads FlawedGrace onto the host. Please see the FlawedGrace section below for more information on how this remote access tool (RAT) is used in Truebot operations. After deployment by Truebot, FlawedGrace is able to modify registry [T1112] and print spooler programs [T1547.012] that control the order that documents are loaded to a print queue. FlawedGrace manipulates these features to both escalate privilege and establish persistence. During FlawedGrace s execution phase, the RAT stores encrypted payloads [T1027.009] within the registry. The tool can create scheduled tasks and inject payloads into msiexec[.]exe and svchost[.]exe, which are command processes that enable FlawedGrace to establish a command and control (C2) connection to 92.118.36[.]199, for example, as well as load dynamic link libraries (DLLs) [T1055.001] to accomplish privilege escalation. Several hours post initial access, Truebot has been observed injecting Cobalt Strike beacons into memory [T1055] in a dormant mode for the first few hours prior to initiating additional operations. Please see the Cobalt Strike section below for more information on how this remote access tool (RAT) is used in Truebot operations. During the first stage of Truebot s execution process, it checks the current version of the operating system (OS) with RtlGetVersion and processor architecture using GetNativeSystemInfo [T1082].[4] Note: This variant of Truebot malware is designed with over one gigabyte (GB) of junk code which functions to hinder detection and analysis efforts [T1027.001]. Following the initial checks for system information, Truebot has the capability to enumerate all running processes [T1057], collect sensitive local host data [T1005], and send this data to an encoded data string described below for second-stage execution. Based on IOCs in table 1, Truebot also has the ability to discover software security protocols and system time metrics, which aids in defense evasion, as well as enables synchronization with the compromised system s internal clock to facilitate scheduling tasks [T1518.001][T1124]. Next, it uses a .JSONIP extension, (e.g., IgtyXEQuCEvAM.JSONIP), to create a thirteen character globally unique identifier (GUID)\u2014a 128-bit text string that Truebot uses to label and organize the data it collects [T1036]. After creating the GUID, Truebot compiles and enumerates running process data into either a base64 or unique hexadecimal encoded string [T1027.001]. Truebot s main goal is identifying the presence of security debugger tools. However, the presence of identified debugger tools does not change Truebot s execution process\u2014the data is compiled into a base64 encoded string for tracking and defense evasion purposes [T1082][T1622]. Following Truebot s enumeration of running processes and tools, the affected system s computer and domain name [T1082][T1016], along with the newly generated GUID, are sent to a hard-coded URL in a POST request (as observed in the user-agent string). Note: A user-agent string is a customized HTTP request that includes specific device information required for interaction with web content. In this instance, cyber threat actors can redirect victims to malicious domains and further establish a C2 connection. The POST request functions as means for establishing a C2 connection for bi-lateral communication. With this established connection, Truebot uses a second obfuscated domain to receive additional payloads [T1105], self-replicate across the environment [T1570], and/or delete files used in its operations [T1070.004]. Truebot malware has the capability to download additional malicious modules [T1105], load shell code [T1620], and deploy various tools to stealthily navigate an infected network. Truebot has been observed in association with the following delivery vectors and tools: Raspberry Robin is a wormable malware with links to other malware families and various infection methods, including installation via USB drive [T1091].[5] Raspberry Robin has evolved into one of the largest malware distribution platforms and has been observed deploying Truebot, as well as other post-compromise payloads such as IcedID and Bumblebee malware.[6] With the recent shift in Truebot delivery methods from malicious emails to the exploitation of CVE-2022-31199, a large number of Raspberry Robin infections have leveraged this exploitable CVE.[2] FlawedGrace is a remote access tool (RAT) that can receive incoming commands [T1059] from a C2 server sent over a custom binary protocol [T1095] using port 443 to deploy additional tools [T1105].[7] Truebot malware has been observed leveraging (and dropping) FlawedGrace via phishing campaigns as an additional payload [T1566.002].[8] Note: FlawedGrace is typically deployed minutes after Truebot malware is executed. Cobalt Strike is a popular remote access tool (RAT) that cyber threat actors have leveraged\u2014in an observable manner\u2014for a variety of post-exploitation means. Typically a few hours after Truebot s execution phase, cyber threat actors have been observed deploying additional payloads containing Cobalt Strike beacons for persistence and data exfiltration purposes [T1059].[2] Cyber threat actors use Cobalt Strike to move laterally via remote service session hijacking [T1563.001][T1563.002], collecting valid credentials through LSASS memory credential dumping, or creating local admin accounts to achieve pass the hash alternate authentication [T1003.001][T1550.002]. Cyber threat actors have been observed using a custom data exfiltration tool, which Talos has named \u201cTeleport.\u201d[2] Teleport is known to evade detection during data exfiltration by using an encryption key hardcoded in the binary and a custom communication protocol [T1095] that encrypts data using advanced encryption standard (AES) and a hardcoded key [T1048][T1573.002]. Furthermore, to maintain its stealth, Teleport limits the data it collects and syncs with outbound organizational data/network traffic [T1029][T1030]. Truebot IOCs from May 31, 2023, contain IOCs from cyber threat actors conducting Truebot malspam campaigns. Information is derived from a trusted third party, they observed cyber threat actors from 193.3.19[.]173 (Russia) using a compromised local account to conduct phishing campaigns on May 23, 2023 and spread malware through: https[:]//snowboardspecs[.]com/nae9v, which then promptly redirects the user to: https://www.meditimespharma[.]com/gfghthq/, which a trusted third party has linked to other trending Truebot activity. After redirecting to https://www.meditimespharma[.]com/gfghthq/, trusted third parties have observed, the cyber threat actors using Truebot to pivot to https://corporacionhardsoft[.]com/images/2/Document_16654.exe, which is a domain associated with snowboardspecs[.]com. This malicious domain has been linked to UNC4509, a threat cluster that has been known to use traffic distribution systems (TDS) to redirect users to either a benign or malicious website to facilitate their malicious phishing campaigns in May 2023. According to trusted third parties, the MD5 Hash: 6164e9d297d29aa8682971259da06848 is downloaded from https://corporacionhardsoft.com/images/2/Document_16654[.]exe, and has been flagged by numerous security vendors, as well as is linked to UNC4509 Truebot campaigns. Note: These IOCs are associated with Truebot campaigns used by Graceful Spider to deliver FlawedGrace and LummaStealer payloads in May of 2023. After Truebot is downloaded, the malware copies itself to C:\\Intel\\RuntimeBroker.exe and\u2014based on trusted third party analysis\u2014links to https://essadonio.com/538332[.]php (which is linked to 45.182.189[.]71 (Panama) and is associated with other trending Truebot malware campaigns from May 2023). Please reference table 1 for IOCs described in the paragraph above."
