                    "data": "Note: This joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) is part of an ongoing #StopRansomware effort to publish advisories for network defenders that detail various ransomware variants and ransomware threat actors. These #StopRansomware advisories include recently and historically observed tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and indicators of compromise (IOCs) to help organizations protect against ransomware. Visit stopransomware.gov to see all #StopRansomware advisories and to learn more about other ransomware threats and no-cost resources. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) to disseminate known IOCs, TTPs, and detection methods associated with the AvosLocker variant identified through FBI investigations as recently as May 2023. AvosLocker operates under a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) model. AvosLocker affiliates have compromised organizations across multiple critical infrastructure sectors in the United States, affecting Windows, Linux, and VMware ESXi environments. AvosLocker affiliates compromise organizations networks by using legitimate software and open-source remote system administration tools. AvosLocker affiliates then use exfiltration-based data extortion tactics with threats of leaking and/or publishing stolen data. This joint CSA updates the March 17, 2022, AvosLocker ransomware joint CSA, Indicators of Compromise Associated with AvosLocker ransomware, released by FBI and the Department of the Treasury s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). This update includes IOCs and TTPs not included in the previous advisory and a YARA rule FBI developed after analyzing a tool associated with an AvosLocker compromise. FBI and CISA encourage critical infrastructure organizations to implement the recommendations in the Mitigations section of this CSA to reduce the likelihood and impact of AvosLocker ransomware and other ransomware incidents.

The NetMonitor executable is configured to use an IP address as its command server, and the program communicates with the server over port 443. During the attack, traffic between NetMonitor and the command server is encrypted, where NetMonitor functions like a reverse proxy and allows actors to connect to the tool from outside the victim s network."

For more information on secure by design, see CISA s Secure by Design and Default webpage and joint guide. FBI and CISA recommend organizations implement the mitigations below to improve your cybersecurity posture on the basis of the threat actor activity and to reduce the risk of compromise by AvosLocker ransomware. These mitigations align with the Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals (CPGs) developed by CISA and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The CPGs provide a minimum set of practices and protections that CISA and NIST recommend all organizations implement. CISA and NIST based the CPGs on existing cybersecurity frameworks and guidance to protect against the most common and impactful threats, tactics, techniques, and procedures.

Furthermore, payment may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to engage in the distribution of ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities. Regardless of whether you or your organization have decided to pay the ransom, the FBI and CISA urge you to promptly report ransomware incidents to the FBI Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) at ic3.gov, local FBI Field Office, or CISA via the agency s Incident Reporting System or its 24/7 Operations Center at report@cisa.gov or by calling 1-844-Say-CISA (1-844-729-2472)."
