This vulnerability occurs in certain versions of PaperCut NG and PaperCut MF and enables an unauthenticated actor to execute malicious code remotely without credentials. PaperCut released a patch in March 2023. According to FBI observed information, malicious actors exploited CVE-2023-27350 beginning in mid-April 2023 and continuing through the present. In early May 2023, also according to FBI information, a group self-identifying as the Bl00dy Ransomware Gang attempted to exploit vulnerable PaperCut servers against the Education Facilities Subsector. This joint advisory provides detection methods for exploitation of CVE-2023-27350 as well and indicators of compromise (IOCs) associated with Bl00dy Ransomware Gang activity. FBI and CISA strongly encourage users and administrators to immediately apply patches, and workarounds if unable to patch. FBI and CISA especially encourage organizations who did not patch immediately to assume compromise and hunt for malicious activity using the detection signatures in this CSA. If potential compromise is detected, organizations should apply the incident response recommendations included in this CSA. Download the PDF version of this report (653kb):"

Commands supplied with the execution of these processes will also run with the same privileges. As a result, a wide range of post-exploitation activity is possible following initial access and compromise. This CVE was added to CISA s Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) Catalog on April 21, 2023. Education Facilities Subsector entities maintained approximately 68% of exposed, but not necessarily vulnerable, U.S.-based PaperCut servers. In early May 2023, according to FBI information, the Bl00dy Ransomware Gang gained access to victim networks across the Education Facilities Subsector where PaperCut servers vulnerable to CVE-2023-27350 were exposed to the internet. Ultimately, some of these operations led to data exfiltration and encryption of victim systems. The Bl00dy Ransomware Gang left ransom notes on victim systems demanding payment in exchange for decryption of encrypted files (see Figure 1)."

A child process is spawned under pc-app.exe when the vulnerable PaperCut software is used to execute another process, which is the PaperCut server process. Malicious activity against PaperCut servers in mid-April used the RCE to supply commands to a cmd.exe or powershell.exe child process, which were then used to conduct further network exploitation. The following YARA rule may detect malicious activity[2]. title: PaperCut MF/NG Vulnerability authors: Huntress DE&TH Team description: Detects suspicious code execution from vulnerable PaperCut versions MF and NG logsource: category: process_creation product: windows detection: selection: ParentImage|endswith: \u201c\\\\pc-app.exe\u201d Image|endswith: - \u201c\\\\cmd.exe\u201d - \u201c\\\\powershell.exe\u201d condition: selection level: high falsepositives: - Expected admin activity More advanced versions of the exploit can drop a backdoor executable, use living-off-the-land binaries, or attempt to evade the above YARA rule by spawning an additional child process in-between pc-app.exe and a command-line interpreter. Network defenders may be able to identify suspicious activity by reviewing the PaperCut server options to identify unfamiliar print scripts or User/Group Sync settings. If the PaperCut Application Server logs have debug mode enabled, lines containing SetupCompleted at a time not correlating with the server installation or upgrade may be indicative of a compromise. Server logs can be found in [app-path]/server/logs/*.* where server.log is normally the most recent log file. Any of the following server log entries may be indicative of a compromise:"
