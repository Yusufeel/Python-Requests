This advisory provides tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) obtained through FBI investigations as recently as November 2023. Scattered Spider is a cybercriminal group that targets large companies and their contracted information technology (IT) help desks. Scattered Spider threat actors, per trusted third parties, have typically engaged in data theft for extortion and have also been known to utilize BlackCat/ALPHV ransomware alongside their usual TTPs. The FBI and CISA encourage critical infrastructure organizations to implement the recommendations in the Mitigations section of this CSA to reduce the likelihood and impact of a cyberattack by Scattered Spider actors.

Scattered Spider (also known as Starfraud, UNC3944, Scatter Swine, and Muddled Libra) engages in data extortion and several other criminal activities.[1] Scattered Spider threat actors are considered experts in social engineering and use multiple social engineering techniques, especially phishing, push bombing, and subscriber identity module (SIM) swap attacks, to obtain credentials, install remote access tools, and/or bypass multi-factor authentication (MFA).

Scattered Spider threat actors have historically evaded detection on target networks by using living off the land techniques and allowlisted applications to navigate victim networks, as well as frequently modifying their TTPs. Observably, Scattered Spider threat actors have exfiltrated data [TA0010] after gaining access and threatened to release it without deploying ransomware; this includes exfiltration to multiple sites including U.S.-based data centers and MEGA[.]NZ [T1567.002]. More recently, the FBI has identified Scattered Spider threat actors now encrypting victim files after exfiltration [T1486]. After exfiltrating and/or encrypting data, Scattered Spider threat actors communicate with victims via TOR, Tox, email, or encrypted applications. Scattered Spider intrusions often begin with broad phishing [T1566] and smishing [T1660] attempts against a target using victim-specific crafted domains, such as the domains listed in Table 3 [T1583.001]."

The threat actors then work to identify the personally identifiable information (PII) of the most valuable users that succumbed to the phishing/smishing, obtaining answers for those users security questions. After identifying usernames, passwords, PII [T1589], and conducting SIM swaps, the threat actors then use social engineering techniques [T1656] to convince IT help desk personnel to reset passwords and/or MFA tokens [T1078.002],[T1199],[T1566.004] to perform account takeovers against the users in single sign-on (SSO) environments. Scattered Spider threat actors then register their own MFA tokens [T1556.006],[T1606] after compromising a user s account to establish persistence [TA0003]. Further, the threat actors add a federated identity provider to the victim s SSO tenant and activate automatic account linking [T1484.002]. The threat actors are then able to sign into any account by using a matching SSO account attribute. At this stage, the Scattered Spider threat actors already control the identity provider and then can choose an arbitrary value for this account attribute. As a result, this activity allows the threat actors to perform privileged escalation [TA0004] and continue logging in even when passwords are changed [T1078]. Additionally, they leverage common endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools installed on the victim networks to take advantage of the tools remote-shell capabilities and executing of commands which elevates their access. They also deploy remote monitoring and management (RMM) tools [T1219] to then maintain persistence. Once persistence is established on a target network, Scattered Spider threat actors often perform discovery, specifically searching for SharePoint sites [T1213.002], credential storage documentation [T1552.001], VMware vCenter infrastructure [T1018], backups, and instructions for setting up/logging into Virtual Private Networks (VPN) [TA0007]. The threat actors enumerate the victim s Active Directory (AD), perform discovery and exfiltration of victim s code repositories [T1213.003], code-signing certificates [T1552.004], and source code [T1083],[TA0010]. Threat actors activate Amazon Web Services (AWS) Systems Manager Inventory [T1538] to discover targets for lateral movement [TA0007],[TA0008], then move to both preexisting [T1021.007] and actor-created [T1578.002] Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances. In instances where the ultimate goal is data exfiltration, Scattered Spider threat actors use actor-installed extract, transform, and load (ETL) tools [T1648] to bring data from multiple data sources into a centralized database [T1074],[T1530]. According to trusted third parties, where more recent incidents are concerned, Scattered Spider threat actors may have deployed BlackCat/ALPHV ransomware onto victim networks\u2014thereby encrypting VMware Elastic Sky X integrated (ESXi) servers [T1486]. To determine if their activities have been uncovered and maintain persistence, Scattered Spider threat actors often search the victim s Slack, Microsoft Teams, and Microsoft Exchange online for emails [T1114] or conversations regarding the threat actor s intrusion and any security response. The threat actors frequently join incident remediation and response calls and teleconferences, likely to identify how security teams are hunting them and proactively develop new avenues of intrusion in response to victim defenses. This is sometimes achieved by creating new identities in the environment [T1136] and is often upheld with fake social media profiles [T1585.001] to backstop newly created identities."

The FBI and CISA recommend organizations implement the mitigations below to improve your organization s cybersecurity posture based on the threat actor activity and to reduce the risk of compromise by Scattered Spider threat actors. These mitigations align with the Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals (CPGs) developed by CISA and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The CPGs provide a minimum set of practices and protections that CISA and NIST recommend all organizations implement. CISA and NIST based the CPGs on existing cybersecurity frameworks and guidance to protect against the most common and impactful threats, tactics, techniques, and procedures. Visit CISA s Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals for more information on the CPGs, including additional recommended baseline protections."
