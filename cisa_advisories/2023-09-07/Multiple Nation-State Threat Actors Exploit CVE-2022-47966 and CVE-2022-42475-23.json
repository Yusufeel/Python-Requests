Analysts confirmed that nation-state advanced persistent threat (APT) actors exploited CVE-2022-47966 to gain unauthorized access to a public-facing application (Zoho ManageEngine ServiceDesk Plus), establish persistence, and move laterally through the network. This vulnerability allows for remote code execution on the ManageEngine application. Additional APT actors were also observed exploiting CVE-2022-42475 to establish presence on the organization s firewall device. CISA and co-sealers are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) to provide network defenders with tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), IOCs, and methods to detect and protect against similar exploitation.

Per the activity conducted, APT actors often scan internet-facing devices for vulnerabilities that can be easily exploited. Firewall, virtual private networks (VPNs), and other edge network infrastructure continue to be of interest to malicious cyber actors. When targeted, they can be leveraged to expand targeted network access, serve as malicious infrastructure, or a mixture of both. As early as January 2023, APT actors exploited CVE-2022-47966 [T1190] for initial access to the organization s web server hosting the public-facing application, Zoho ManageEngine ServiceDesk Plus. CISA observed indications in log files that a connection to the known malicious IP address 192.142.226[.]153 was made as part of initial exploitation. Through exploitation of CVE-2022-47966, APT actors achieved root level access on the web server and created a local user account [T1136.001] named Azure with administrative privileges [T1068]. Actors were further able to download malware, enumerate the network, collect administrative user credentials, and move laterally through the organization s network. CISA and co-sealers were unable to determine if proprietary information was accessed, altered, or exfiltrated. This was due to the organization not clearly defining where their data was centrally located and CISA having limited network sensor coverage. Additional APT actors exploited CVE-2022-42475 on the organization s firewall device, which was indicated by multiple successful VPN connections from known-malicious IPs between February 1-16, 2023. It was identified that APT actors compromised and used disabled, legitimate administrative account credentials [T1078.003] from a previously hired contractor\u2014of which the organization confirmed the user had been disabled prior to the observed activity. Analysis identified that a common behavior for these threat actors was to use disabled administrative account credentials and delete logs from several critical servers in the environment [T1070.001]. This prevented the ability to detect follow-on exploitation or data exfiltration. CISA and co-sealers were also unable to further track the activity due to the organization not having Network Address Translation (NAT) IP logging enabled. APT actors initiated multiple Transport Layer Security (TLS)-encrypted sessions [T1573.002] on Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) port 10443 [T1571], indicating successful exchanges of data transfer from the firewall device. APT actors were observed connecting to the device from the following actor-controlled C2 IP addresses:"

Local accounts are those configured by an organization for use by users, remote support, services, or for administration on a single system or service. Such accounts may be used to establish secondary credentialed access that do not require persistent remote access tools to be deployed on the system. 2023-01-21 06:50:59 Mimikatz.exe downloaded via ConnectWise ScreenConnect. The legitimate ConnectWise ScreenConnect client was utilized to connect to the ServiceDesk system, download mimikatz.exe, and execute malicious payloads to steal credentials [T1219], [T1588.002]. Note: ConnectWise ScreenConnect was observed in multiple locations within the organization s environment, but the organization confirmed that it was not authorized software. Analysis assessed APT actors downloaded the legitimate software for malicious, illegitimate use prior to the download of mimikatz.exe. 2023-01-21 07:34:32 Bitmap.exe malware downloaded and designated to connect to C2 IP 179.60.147[.]4. Azure user account downloaded bitmap.exe to the ServiceDesk system to execute an obfuscated, embedded malicious payload from its C2 server [T1027.009]. This malware is identified as a variant of Metasploit (Meterpreter). See MAR-10430311-1.v1 for additional details. 2023-01-21 08:46:23 Mimikatz credential dump files created. Two files (c:\\windows\\system32\\fuu.txt, c:\\windows\\system32\\jojo.txt) were created as means for Mimikatz to dump/write credentials to disk on the ServiceDesk system [T1003]. 2023-01-21 09:25:58 Legitimate files/applications nmap.exe and npcap.exe downloaded. Azure user account downloaded nmap.exe [T1018] and npcap.exe [T1040] to continue network and credential information gathering efforts. Though legitimate applications, APT actors used these files for illegitimate, malicious purposes. Note: Adversaries may gather information about the victim's network topology that can be used during targeting. Information about network topologies may include a variety of details, including the physical and/or logical arrangement of both external-facing and internal network environments. This information may also include specifics regarding network devices (gateways, routers, etc.) and other infrastructure. 2023-01-21 13:56:14 ssh2.zip downloaded by the Azure user account. APT actors downloaded the file ssh2.zip via the Azure user account, which contained legitimate files that could have been leveraged for malicious purposes. When unzipped, the following files were extracted:"

Ngrok [3] Ngrok software operates by running a client process on the machine and creating a private connection tunnel to a designated open port. Ngrok delivers instant ingress to applications in any cloud, private network, or devices with authentication, load balancing, and other critical controls. In recent years, Ngrok has been leveraged maliciously by a variety of threat actors, including use for persistence, lateral movement, and data exfiltration.[4],[5],[6] Using Ngrok as an external service, APT actors were able to gain access to and utilize the command line on victim systems. Note: CISA and co-sealers have observed this commonly used commercial platform being abused by malicious actors to bypass typical firewall controls. Ngrok s ability to tunnel RDP and other services securely over internet connections makes it a target for abuse by malicious actors. ProcDump A command-line application used to monitor processes and create crash dump files. A crash dump file contains the data loaded in memory at the time the dump was triggered. It is typically used for troubleshooting errors with an application or operating system. APT actors used ProcDump to conduct reconnaissance and examine spawned processes (applications in use). This tool was also utilized as a utility for dumping credentials from the server hosting ServiceDesk Plus. Metasploit Metasploit is an open-source penetration testing software.  APT actors specific use of Meterpreter\u2014an attack payload of Metasploit\u2014serves as an interactive shell and allows threat actors to control and execute code on a system. Interact.sh An open-source tool for detecting external interactions (communication).[7] This tool is used to detect callbacks from target systems for specified vulnerabilities and commonly used during the reconnaissance stages of adversary activity. APT actors likely used Interact.sh to refrain from using and disclosing their own C2 infrastructure. anydesk.exe A remote desktop application that provides platform-independent remote access to personal computers and other devices running the host application. It offers remote control, file transfer, and VPN functionality.  Between early-February and mid-March 2023, anydesk.exe was observed on three hosts with different certificate issuers and hashes\u2014none of which were the certified issuer [T1553.002].
