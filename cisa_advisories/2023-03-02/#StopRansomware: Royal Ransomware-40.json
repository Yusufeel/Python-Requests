End of Update Note: This joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) is part of an ongoing #StopRansomware effort to publish advisories for network defenders that detail various ransomware variants and ransomware threat actors. These #StopRansomware advisories include recently and historically observed tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and indicators of compromise (IOCs) to help organizations protect against ransomware. Visit stopransomware.gov to see all #StopRansomware advisories and to learn more about other ransomware threats and no-cost resources. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) are releasing this joint CSA to disseminate known Royal ransomware IOCs and TTPs identified through FBI threat response activities as recently as June 2023. Since approximately September 2022, cyber threat actors have compromised U.S. and international organizations with Royal ransomware. FBI and CISA believe this variant, which uses its own custom-made file encryption program, evolved from earlier iterations that used \u201cZeon\u201d as a loader. After gaining access to victims networks, Royal actors disable antivirus software and exfiltrate large amounts of data before ultimately deploying the ransomware and encrypting the systems. Royal actors have made ransom demands ranging from approximately $1 million to $11 million USD in Bitcoin. In observed incidents, Royal actors do not include ransom amounts and payment instructions as part of the initial ransom note. Instead, the note, which appears after encryption, requires victims to directly interact with the threat actor via a .onion URL (reachable through the Tor browser). Royal actors have targeted numerous critical infrastructure sectors including, but not limited to, Manufacturing, Communications, Healthcare and Public Healthcare (HPH), and Education. Update November 13, 2023 Since September 2022, Royal has targeted over 350 known victims worldwide and ransomware demands have exceeded 275 million USD. Royal conducts data exfiltration and extortion prior to encryption and then publishes victim data to a leak site if a ransom is not paid. Phishing emails are among the most successful vectors for initial access by Royal threat actors. There are indications that Royal may be preparing for a re-branding effort and/or a spinoff variant. Blacksuit ransomware shares a number of identified coding characteristics similar to Royal. A previous joint CSA for Royal ransomware was published on March 2, 2023. This joint CSA provides updated IOCs identified through FBI investigations. End Update FBI and CISA encourage organizations to implement the recommendations found in the Mitigations section of this CSA to reduce the likelihood and impact of ransomware incidents.

Royal ransomware uses a unique partial encryption approach that allows the threat actor to choose a specific percentage of data in a file to encrypt. This approach allows the actor to lower the encryption percentage for larger files, which helps evade detection.[1] In addition to encrypting files, Royal actors also engage in double extortion tactics in which they threaten to publicly release the encrypted data if the victim does not pay the ransom. Royal actors gain initial access to victim networks in several ways including:"

Legitimate Windows software is repurposed by Royal operators to strengthen their foothold within the victim s network. Ransomware operators often use open source projects to aid their intrusion activities\u2014Royal operators have recently been observed using Chisel, a tunneling tool transported over HTTP and secured via SSH [T1572], to communicate with their C2 infrastructure. FBI observed multiple Qakbot C2s used in Royal ransomware attacks but is yet to determine if Royal ransomware exclusively uses Qakbot C2s. Royal threat actors often use RDP to move laterally across a network [T1021.001]. Microsoft Sysinternals tool PsExec has also been used to aid lateral movement. FBI observed Royal threat actors using remote monitoring and management (RMM) software, such as AnyDesk, LogMeIn, and Atera for persistence in the victim s network [T1133]. In some instances, the threat actors moved laterally to the domain controller. In one confirmed case, the threat actors used a legitimate admin account to remotely log on to the domain controller [T1078]. Once on the domain controller, the threat actor deactivated antivirus protocols [T1562.001] by modifying Group Policy Objects [T1484.001]. Royal threat actors exfiltrate data from victim networks by repurposing legitimate cyber penetration testing tools such as Cobalt Strike and malware tools and derivatives such as Ursnif/Gozi for data aggregation and exfiltration. According to third-party reporting, Royal threat actors first hop in exfiltration and other operations is usually a U.S. IP address. Note: In reference to Cobalt Strike and other tools mentioned above, a tool repository used by Royal was identified at IP: 94.232.41[.]105 in December 2022.
