In October 2022, CISA identified a widespread cyber campaign involving the malicious use of legitimate RMM software. Specifically, cyber criminal actors sent phishing emails that led to the download of legitimate RMM software\u2014ScreenConnect (now ConnectWise Control) and AnyDesk\u2014which the actors used in a refund scam to steal money from victim bank accounts. Although this campaign appears financially motivated, the authoring organizations assess it could lead to additional types of malicious activity. For example, the actors could sell victim account access to other cyber criminal or advanced persistent threat (APT) actors. This campaign highlights the threat of malicious cyber activity associated with legitimate RMM software: after gaining access to the target network via phishing or other techniques, malicious cyber actors\u2014from cybercriminals to nation-state sponsored APTs\u2014are known to use legitimate RMM software as a backdoor for persistence and/or command and control (C2). Using portable executables of RMM software provides a way for actors to establish local user access without the need for administrative privilege and full software installation\u2014effectively bypassing common software controls and risk management assumptions. The authoring organizations strongly encourage network defenders to review the Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) and Mitigations sections in this CSA and apply the recommendations to protect against malicious use of legitimate RMM software.

The authoring organizations assess that since at least June 2022, cyber criminal actors have sent help desk-themed phishing emails to FCEB federal staff s personal, and government email addresses. The emails either contain a link to a \u201cfirst-stage\u201d malicious domain or prompt the recipients to call the cybercriminals, who then try to convince the recipients to visit the first-stage malicious domain. See figure 1 for an example phishing email obtained from an FCEB network. "

The executable then connects to a \u201csecond-stage\u201d malicious domain, from which it downloads additional RMM software. CISA noted that the actors did not install downloaded RMM clients on the compromised host. Instead, the actors downloaded AnyDesk and ScreenConnect as self-contained, portable executables configured to connect to the actor s RMM server. Note: Portable executables launch within the user s context without installation. Because portable executables do not require administrator privileges, they can allow execution of unapproved software even if a risk management control may be in place to audit or block the same software s installation on the network. Threat actors can leverage a portable executable with local user rights to attack other vulnerable machines within the local intranet or establish long term persistent access as a local user service. CISA has observed that multiple first-stage domain names follow naming patterns used for IT help/support themed social-engineering, e.g., hservice[.]live, gscare[.]live, nhelpcare[.]info, deskcareme[.]live, nhelpcare[.]cc). According to Silent Push, some of these malicious domains impersonate known brands such as, Norton, GeekSupport, Geek Squad, Amazon, Microsoft, McAfee, and PayPal.[1] CISA has also observed that the first-stage malicious domain linked in the initial phishing email periodically redirects to other sites for additional redirects and downloads of RMM software. In this campaign, after downloading the RMM software, the actors used the software to initiate a refund scam. They first connected to the recipient s system and enticed the recipient to log into their bank account while remaining connected to the system. The actors then used their access through the RMM software to modify the recipient s bank account summary. The falsely modified bank account summary showed the recipient was mistakenly refunded an excess amount of money. The actors then instructed the recipient to \u201crefund\u201d this excess amount to the scam operator. Although this specific activity appears to be financially motivated and targets individuals, the access could lead to additional malicious activity against the recipient s organization\u2014from both other cybercriminals and APT actors.

These threat actors can exploit trust relationships in MSP networks and gain access to a large number of the victim MSP's customers.
