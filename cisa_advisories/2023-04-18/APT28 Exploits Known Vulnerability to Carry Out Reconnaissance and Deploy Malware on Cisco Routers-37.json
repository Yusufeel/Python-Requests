We assess that APT28 is almost certainly the Russian General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU) 85th special Service Centre (GTsSS) Military Intelligence Unit 26165. APT28 (also known as Fancy Bear, STRONTIUM, Pawn Storm, the Sednit Gang and Sofacy) is a highly skilled threat actor. Download the UK PDF version of this report:"

                    "data": "For more information on APT28 activity, see the advisory Russian State-Sponsored and Criminal Cyber Threats to Critical Infrastructure and Russian GRU Conducting Global Brute Force Campaign to Compromise Enterprise and Cloud Environments. As of 2021, APT28 has been observed using commercially available code repositories, and post-exploit frameworks such as Empire. This included the use of PowerShell Empire, in addition to Python versions of Empire. In 2021, APT28 used infrastructure to masquerade Simple Network Management protocol (SNMP) access into Cisco routers worldwide. This included a small number based in Europe, US government institutions and approximately 250 Ukrainian victims. SNMP is designed to allow network administrators to monitor and configure network devices remotely, but it can also be misused to obtain sensitive network information and, if vulnerable, exploit devices to penetrate a network. A number of software tools can scan the entire network using SNMP, meaning that poor configuration such as using default or easy-to-guess community strings, can make a network susceptible to attacks. Weak SNMP community strings, including the default \"public,\" allowed APT28 to gain access to router information. APT28 sent additional SNMP commands to enumerate router interfaces. [T1078.001] The compromized routers were configured to accept SNMP v2 requests. SNMP v2 doesn t support encryption and so all data, including community strings, is sent unencrypted. Exploitation of CVE-2017-6742 APT28 exploited the vulnerability CVE-2017-6742 (Cisco Bug ID: CSCve54313) [T1190]. This vulnerability was first announced by Cisco on 29 June 2017, and patched software was made available. Cisco's published advisory provided workarounds, such as limiting access to SNMP from trusted hosts only, or by disabling a number of SNMP Management Information bases (MIBs). For some of the targeted devices, APT28 actors used an SNMP exploit to deploy malware, as detailed in the NCSC s Jaguar Tooth Malware Analysis Report. This malware obtained further device information, which is exfiltrated over trivial file transfer protocol (TFTP), and enabled unauthenticated access via a backdoor. The actor obtained this device information by executing a number of Command Line Interface (CLI) commands via the malware. It includes discovery of other devices on the network by querying the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) table to obtain MAC addresses. [T1590] Please refer to the accompanying Malware Analysis Report for indicators of compromise which may help to detect this activity. This advisory has been compiled with respect to the MITRE ATT&CK framework, a globally accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations. For detailed TTPs, see the Malware Analysis Report."
