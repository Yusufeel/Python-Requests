This recently disclosed vulnerability affects certain versions of Atlassian Confluence Data Center and Server, enabling malicious cyber threat actors to obtain initial access to Confluence instances by creating unauthorized Confluence administrator accounts. Threat actors exploited CVE-2023-22515 as a zero-day to obtain access to victim systems and continue active exploitation post-patch. Atlassian has rated this vulnerability as critical; CISA, FBI, and MS-ISAC expect widespread, continued exploitation due to ease of exploitation. CISA, FBI, and MS-ISAC strongly encourage network administrators to immediately apply the upgrades provided by Atlassian. CISA, FBI, and MS-ISAC also encourage organizations to hunt for malicious activity on their networks using the detection signatures and indicators of compromise (IOCs) in this CSA. If a potential compromise is detected, organizations should apply the incident response recommendations. For additional information on upgrade instructions, a complete list of affected product versions, and IOCs, see Atlassian s security advisory for CVE-2023-22515.[1] While Atlassian s advisory provides interim measures to temporarily mitigate known attack vectors, CISA, FBI, and MS-ISAC strongly encourage upgrading to a fixed version or taking servers offline to apply necessary updates.

                    "data": "Unauthenticated remote threat actors can exploit this vulnerability to create unauthorized Confluence administrator accounts and access Confluence instances. More specifically, threat actors can change the Confluence server s configuration to indicate the setup is not complete and use the /setup/setupadministrator.action endpoint to create a new administrator user. The vulnerability is triggered via a request on the unauthenticated /server-info.action endpoint. Considering the root cause of the vulnerability allows threat actors to modify critical configuration settings, CISA, FBI, and MS-ISAC assess that the threat actors may not be limited to creating new administrator accounts. Open source further indicates an Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) classification of injection (i.e., CWE-20: Improper Input Validation) is an appropriate description.[2] Atlassian released a patch on October 4, 2023, and confirmed that threat actors exploited CVE-2023-22515 as a zero-day\u2014a previously unidentified vulnerability.[1] On October 5, 2023, CISA added this vulnerability to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog based on evidence of active exploitation. Due to the ease of exploitation, CISA, FBI, and MS-ISAC expect to see widespread exploitation of unpatched Confluence instances in government and private networks. Post-exploitation exfiltration of data can be executed through of a variety of techniques. A predominant method observed involves the use of cURL\u2014a command line tool used to transfer data to or from a server. An additional data exfiltration technique observed includes use of Rclone [S1040]\u2014a command line tool used to sync data to cloud and file hosting services such as Amazon Web Services and China-based UCloud Information Technology Limited. Note: This does not preclude the effectiveness of alternate methods, but highlights methods observed to date. Threat actors were observed using Rclone to either upload a configuration file to victim infrastructure or enter cloud storage credentials via the command line. Example configuration file templates are listed in the following Figures 1 and 2, which are populated with the credentials of the exfiltration point:"
